# Welcome to my Homelab!

Hello stranger! You've arrived at my repository where I document my on-going projects within my homelab. I hope you find my work interesting and leave with learning something. Let's get right into it!

## Infrastructure

I'm going to split this part into two sections, physical and virtual. This will give you a clear picture on the high-level components and its underlying hardware.

### Physical

- Dell R710
1. 2 x Intel Xeon E5530
1. 6 x 32gb RAM
- Ubiquiti Edgerouter Lite 3
- TP-Link Managed Switch
- Netgear Nighthawk Wireless Router
- 2 x TrippLite APCs
- Synology 2-Bay 16 TB/ 20 TB Network Attached Storage (DS216play) 
- Still a WIP...
