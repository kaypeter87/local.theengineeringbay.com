# Welcome to my Homelab!

Hello stranger! You've arrived at my repository where I document my on-going projects within my homelab. I hope you find my work interesting and leave with learning something. Let's get right into it!

## Infrastructure

I'm going to split this part in two sections, physical and virtual. I feel this will give a big picture on the high-level pieces and its underlying components.

### Physical

- Dell R710
- Ubiquiti Edgerouter Lite 3
- TP-Link Managed Switch
- Netgear Nighthawk Wireless Router
- Still a WIP...
